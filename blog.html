				<h2>The behind history of Bestie cafe</h2>
				<p>Baby, which opened today in the old Eden Terrace location of Bluebells Cakery (which has since relocated to Kingsland), has given the once-simple room a colourful, eclectic makeover.</p>
				<br>
				<p>“When we got the new space we were like ‘oh my god, this is massive!’,” says Emma.</p>
				<br>
				<p>“There’s not a single bench in the new place that’s as small as the bench we work on at Bestie.”</p>
				<br>
				<p>Emma claims that the most important lesson she learned from the first enterprise was to take things gently and add additional obstacles only when they felt ready. “Now we make everything ourselves, like all the pickles, and we've developed our own cups and done wonderful fun collabs that we wouldn't have been able to do if we attempted to do everything at once,” she says.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Despite her extensive expertise in the industry, Bestie was Emma's first managerial position, and she described the experience as a "trial by fire."Plus, when Tane and Emma built Bestie, they were taking over the premises of Alleluya, a long-running cafe that some people were disappointed to see close. People entered the cafe with their noses up, figuring it was owned by developers rather than an owner-operated business.</p>
				<br>
				<p>
				“This one is a pretty chill spot, there’s not a lot of foot traffic, we can do what we like and no one minds,” says Emma.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
				"Now I know how to hire staff, I know the food that I like and the style that we're best at, so it’s definitely easier."
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
				Her partner Tane looks after their cafes’ design and she says it makes it easy that they’re completely on the same page. “Any ideas we couldn’t do [at Bestie] we’re like ‘Oh yeah let’s do that!’.”
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
				They plan to split their time between the two cafes, with Baby open on weekdays until things settle down a little.
